st.markdown('6. From 1850 to 2019, humans released around 2,390 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. One gigatonne is equivalent to one billion metric tonnes, so thats a lot of carbon dioxide. So far these emissions have led to 1.07C of warming when compared to pre-industrial levels.')
st.markdown('7. Temperatures in the Arctic region are rising faster than almost anywhere else on the planet. Between 2011 and 2020, annual Arctic sea ice reached its lowest level since at least 1850 and late summer Arctic sea ice was smaller than at any time in at least the past 1,000 years.')
